# My Web Development Journey

There was a time when I didn't even know what a `<div>` was.  
I still remember the day I wrote my first “Hello, World!” in HTML — it felt like magic.  
That one line opened the door to a whole new world.

Every day since, I’ve been showing up.  
6 to 7 hours a day, consistently — learning, breaking, building, and trying again.  
From struggling with CSS positioning to writing responsive layouts,  
From wondering what JavaScript does to making buttons come alive —  
Every moment has been a mix of frustration, discovery, and joy.

This repository is not a finished project.  
It’s a **work in progress**, just like me.  
It holds pieces of everything I’ve learned —  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks, designs, experiments, mistakes… and growth.

I’m still learning.  
I haven’t completed the journey — but that’s the beauty of it.  
The process matters more than the destination.  
This is where I track my evolution, one line of code at a time.

If you’re reading this and you’re also learning,  
Know that you’re not alone. Keep showing up.  
Your future self will thank you for not giving up.

## What You’ll Find Here

## Why This Exists

This isn’t just a place to push code.  
It’s a digital diary of my dedication,  
A canvas for my curiosity,  
And a commitment to never stop learning.
